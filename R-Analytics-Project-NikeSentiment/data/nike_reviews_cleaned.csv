Noelia R.,New Jersey 1 review 2 helpful votes,New Jersey,Horrible warranty,Nike supposedly has a two year warranty but it starts when the shoe was manufactured not when you purchased it. Basically you can buy a pair today and they could be falling apart 6 months later and they will not honor the warranty if it was made over 2 years ago.How am I to know as a consumer when the shoe was manufactured? I can tell you when I purchased it how much it cost and that it's defective. They should put an expiration date on your receipt so you can shop for their product as you would milk. Both pairs are less than 2 years old,September 26 2024,26/9/2024,Helpful (2),2,,,1,2,1,5,1,2

This was from normal use while playing tennis. Obviously, any quality shoe should not develop a hole in them after only two months of normal use, so we filed a warranty claim with Nike. We had to spend $16 dollars shipping from the Bay Area in Northern California to the warranty address at Nike, which was the cheapest cost available (and unreasonably high). I received a quick rejection to my claim, stating this was normal wear and tear. They left no way for me to respond to them. I faxed two letters successfully to their Corporate Office and didn't receive the courtesy of a reply. I filed a complaint with the BBB and Nike refused again to attempt to satisfy us as customers.

So some variety in the line and maybe some retro tennis sneakers with a 70's or 80's look would be welcome.

Those tags tend to fade sometimes with the wearing of the shoes, but they don't seem to understand that, I even offered a copy of my receipt and that didn't matter to them. My family has bought a ton of Nike products for many years, I always thought they would stand by their products but I was wrong. Be careful what you buy from them and how much you spend as they may not stand by the sometimes poor quality of their products.

Nike did not even think to offer even a 50%, 10%, or even 1% discount on a new pair of shoes. They didn't offer to take them back and repair them.

At 150 pounds a pair I would expect perfection from their side. I returned them after i send photos to their email adress with the hope that if I will buy another one will look like I would expect even though I had to wait one week for the money to be back in my account. They offered a discount and that is why I have decided to give them another chance. The second pair, a new type of defects worse like the first one. I have the feeling that no one is doing any kind of quality check. I had the thought that a fake replica of this shoes will look better than the original since some of them pass as genuine all the time. Very disappointed, not because of their service but because of the product.

Long story short my daughter bought Nike TN's on sale. After 3 months of wearing the soles were so worn down they looked like they were owned for years. Contacted Nike who had Foot Locker contact me(which took long till Matthew from there contacted me) he told us we could exchange for other color or shoe etc. We went to Foot locker only to have to deal with an annoying manager (Julianne) who tries to give me explainations as to why they are wore out and that she should not be wearing them everyday. Seriously?! Also to get a different color same shoe we had to pay the difference. I forgot to mention my daughter in 20 and not an athlete just wears them to walk. So Julianne would not accept the email and tells me to come back another day so she could get in touch with Matthew. It takes me 1/2 hr by car and 1hr by bus I was not leaving without a shoe. So after 3 hrs of wasting my time she finally get in touch with Matthew who now tells me because they do not have the same color she needs to pay the difference to get a different color. Well that is not what the email said. Did get our money back but had been hassled few weeks before that from again Julianne who back then refused us an exchange or a refund. Also my son bought TN'S full price which also fell apart. Those also were returned. So Nike and Foot Locker are absolutely horrible in customer service and quality of workmanship. What do I get in return for the stress and my wasted time? Nothing. Stay away from Foot Locker especially in Cairns Central Australia.,June 26 2019,26/6/2019,Helpful (15),15,,,1,0,0,0,0,0

I'm neutral about this situation because Nike didn't really do anything wrong and their website and process was very easy to handle which is why I gave them 5-star because I didn't want to be biased. However, read the returns instructions carefully. I was under the impression that Nike has a free shipping (minimum order) and free returns policy.  I took a risk (first order on Nike) and bought this $220 jacket that categorized itself as loose fit, so I went with their smallest size on the chart which was XS. I'm normally a size S in everything USA. When this XS jacket turned out too big still, I thought \no problem I'll just return\"". I went through the process and it turns out the return label for guests is just a mailer label. It's not a pre-paid return label which is for members only. I made an account after to see if I could get the pre-paid label but of course it didn't recognize my order even though the account and order was made from the same email.  Now I have to commute 1 hour to a Nike store to return because this jacket is so large and heavy shipping it back would cost at least $30 and I'm responsible for it if it's lost in transit. Unless you want to make an account just for that ONE item at Nike I would say don't bother unless you're ok with paying for returns.

It's the legitimate online platform where customers can purchase Nike products directly from the company. However, it's important to be cautious online, as there might be fraudulent websites that mimic the appearance of legitimate sites like Nike.com in an attempt to deceive customers.  To ensure you're on the authentic Nike website, here are a few tips:  Check the URL: Make sure the web address is correct. The official Nike website is www.nike.com.  Look for Security Features: Legitimate websites often have security features like HTTPS in the URL and a padlock symbol in the address bar, indicating a secure connection.  Check Contact Information: Authentic websites usually have clear contact information, including a physical address, customer service phone number, and email address.  Research the Site: Look for reviews or information about the website online. If it's a scam or a fake site, there might be warnings or negative reviews from other users.  Be Wary of Deals Too Good to Be True: If the prices seem unbelievably low or if the website is offering extreme discounts that seem too good to be true, it might be a red flag for a fake site.  If you're uncertain about a website claiming to be Nike or have any suspicions about its authenticity, it's best to refrain from making any purchases and, instead, directly visit the official Nike website or use authorized retailers to ensure a secure shopping experience.",December 10 2023,10/12/2023,Helpful (0),0,,,5,0,0,0,0,0

When I tried to use it in a nike store (after picking items I wanted to buy), the cashier told me that I could only use it online. When I went to the online store, the card gave an error.  I called customer services and after waiting for many minutes to speak to someone, and for that someone to speak to someone else... she told me that the card had expired, but that \I shouldn't worry\"" because they would issue me a new one... which would take 3 - 5 days and she would call me to give me the new card number...  The story is clear and honest. The issue may seem to have been solved. BUT imagine buying a 'gift' for someone and him/her having to go through such a hassle to be able to use that gift?! This is not customer-centred service it is organization-centred service! This was even clearer when the lady said she could only call me (and not email me) because she is a phone-agent. Apparently phone agents and email agents are different people sitting in different departments and the organisational system does not allow them to communicate with each other. Unbelievable! Awful awful experience. I am never stepping into a nike store again.""",October 11 2019,11/10/2019,Helpful (1),1,,,1,0,0,0,0,0

But just because they're legit doesn't mean they're the greatest place to order from. Recently, I ordered a pair of shoes from here and I ordered them at like 6 A. M on August 1st. By noon they sent me an email telling me that my order has been shipped. I was in awe. Like, WHAT? It's only been a few hours! But yep, about a day later I received an email from UPS (I'm enrolled in UPS My Choice, its a great program if UPS ever delivers to your house and if someone is trying to surprise you with a gift and it gets sent to your house. You'll get the email) the email was telling me that my package will arrive on Monday the 5th between 2:45pm and 6:45 pm. Super specific.  I'm thinking, wow this is the best order I've ever gotten. And lo and behold on Monday the 5th at 2:52 pm my package arrived. And it was in a big box and in that box was another box with the shoes in them. I liked it better because no one could tell I had ordered shoes. Oh Nike, you've won my heart.

Two sweatshirts arrived separately within a couple weeks. The AF1s I ordered for my daughter said they shipped around the same time and a FedEx tracking number was provided. It seemed like shipping was taking a really long time so I checked the tracking and FedEx never received the package. I decided to contact customer service because two weeks had passed since the tracking number was issued. After more than 30 minutes in chat with \Jom\"" whose communication was a mix of auto response and really bad English I was informed that \""FedEx lost the package\"" (funny since they never received it) and did I want a reship or refund. I requested reship and was then told the shoe was out of stock and my only option was a refund. I expressed that my daughter was going to be really disappointed and was told I should shop for the shoes elsewhere!?#@! I asked if the shoes were \""found\"" if they would still be shipped and was told my only option was a refund. I asked for details/documentation of the refund. Chat has timed out twice now and despite being told I would get documentation \""Jom\"" has not provided it. I guess this is the last time I'll be shopping Nike - what a joke and total waste of time.

No mind - black consumers (of which I am one) tend to have huge buying power when it comes to sports apparel. \A new report from Nielsen on the current buying power of consumers of color offers a fascinating look at how we're spending our money. In the report Black Dollars Matter: The Sales Impact of Black Consumers the message is clear: While African Americans make up just 14% of the population you will find black people and those who consider themselves allies will be purchasing more and more Nike goods. I bet if you look at their profit margins in the next half year or so you will find that they will have increased. Also there is the small issue of demographics. The world population is 7.4 billion. The demographic of those who are burning Nike goods number 8500000.

Marcos R.,New York 1 review 0 helpful votes,New York,Horrific experience,"My experience as a Nike Member has been nothing short of horrific. My package was stolen by the shippers. I just spoke with a customer service rep yes I was refunded but of course Air Jordan 4 Retro these are limited sneakers the are not in stock. I'm extremely disappointed in Nike for deciding to do business with a corrupt and disgusting company. I checked the tracking, and it says the shoes are in transit https://t.lasership.com/Track/1LSCXM*******B5E The estimated delivery date was 10/12/2022, however they have been at the Secaucus, NJ Laser ship Facility since 1012/2022 1:00 AM, and it currently 9:00 AM 10/14/2022 Nike is associating itself with a company who's been reported for damaging and stealing the personal property of recipients. The company has been penalized by multiple governments for misclassifying drivers as independent contractors, and for delivering untaxed cigarettes (for which the company was prosecuted under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act.

My partner calls DPD who said that they will get the depot to call. This was at about 1:30 p.m. at 5 p.m. she call DPD back and a different agent stated that the label on the package did not have the first line of the address on it so they could not deliver it. We asked why they didn't call the phone number that they have to confirm door number they then stated that they don't do that and that they will not be able to deliver it again at all as the label is wrong. We called EE who arranged for my partner to pick this up from a pick up point the next day. No apology and no offer of compensation even though they were told that this was a birthday present.  Deliver 2) my partners ordered shoes from Nike.com and deliver was through DPD. On the day of delivery notifications received saying that it is on its way and partners actively tracked it on her phone until it said that DPD were here, we waited for the bell to ring but nothing. 5 min later we received a notification stating that no one was home and a photo of our front door. We called DPDD customer service and spoke to Corey who allegedly tried to call the drover but could not get tgrouch and then we're told that there is nothing they can do.

Earl E.,Illinois 1 review 0 helpful votes,Illinois,Nike shoe review,I would like to recommend Nike shoes because they are very comfortable. You will never want to take Nike shoes off because they are so comfortable. There are so many kinds of Nike shoes and you can get a pair just for you. You can get your Nike shoes at Amazon right now. The price of the shoes are about 100$. The models I have are Giannas Immortals. I love them.  I tried Nike shoes for the first time because I heard they were very comfortable from the Amazon reviews. Well most of the NBA players wear Nike shoes. I wasn't getting much traction on the court until I wore Giannas Immortals. About 80% of the NBA players wear these. I am credible because I have worn these shoes for seven years. I have this product for my basketball shoes and have had them for practice and games. I would recommend Nike shoes over any other shoe because they are very comfortable and have the best traction for the basketball court.  The Giannias Immortals are very comfortable. I have tried several different types of shoes but nothing like these. My favorite by far are the Giannias Immortals. When I am running I do not have any problems with my feet hurting. There are a variety of different types of Nike shoes. These are made with ankle support. When I was going up for a rebound I came down and rolled my ankle but it did not stop me from going out of the game because of the great ankle support. They also have great traction. Nike shoes are always improving their traction. In my experience I never had to worry about falling down because of the great traction.  I recommend this to people that like to play basketball or run. I recommend it to this type because you want to feel comfortable on the court and want to be safe. It is a little pricey but worth it. I would not recommend you wearing outside of the court.,December 17 2023,17/12/2023,Helpful (0),0,,,5,,,,,

On the 4/11/21 I made a complaint and requested a refund to an alternative account as my old account got closed but they sent it to the account anyway!  I did not find this out until 11/11/21 and I spent over 6 hours being passed from pillar to post getting conflicting information! I made several complaints and was told that a manager would call back in 48 hours which of course didn't happen.  I then called again and had the phone dropped on me twice. I then called again to complain about the terrible communication issues and conflicting information I have been given.  I called in the next day as for a 2nd time I did not receive the manager callback!  At this point I was furious as it has cost me more to contact Nike than I am getting as a refund and it is becoming very stressful and distressing.  After 6 days I receive an email from a manager Eric who had NO empathy and kept talking over me as I explained the situation. I cannot believe the fact that I STILL HAVENT RECIEVED MY REFUND AND IVE SPENT SO MUCH TIME AND MINEY TRYING TO GET IT BACK!  I am extremely disgusted and feel very undervalued by Nike.

mia m.,New Jersey 1 review 1 helpful vote,New Jersey,By far the worst online shopping experience,"I've had one bad experience but the last one was it. Had to cancel multiple orders, after the first order went to a wrong shipping address. Somehow it automatically signed me into an old acct with an old address - when i paid via paypal, paypal told me i'd be able to 'change the address' before checking out at nike.com. I clicked on next, and then it just confirmed my order. So i canceled it bc i couldn't change the address after calling. Then i got a notice saying 'your order was not canceled'. So i called. They couldn't find the order. The order confirmation went to a different email - not sure why because it wasn't the email i used for the order. The nike integration with Paypal or 3rd parties is really clumsy and not user friendly. You should be able to call and change shipping address (like any other site) without having to re-do the order. The order should go to the actual email you ordered it from. You should get a confirmation of order cancellation. Most of all, it should NOT take me 63 minutes to order a pair of $100 shoes online. I should not have to contact customer service twice. I get it - Nike is so loaded they don't have to provide an excellent online experience - but it really would be nice. I once ordered from Nike a yr ago and couldn't remember why I didn't again - it was because in that order, they wouldn't even deliver it to my house because I wasn't home and delivered it to some random UPS drop off point which was closed when i got home from work - so the item was automatically sent back to Nike. I can't with them anymore. If it's not avail with another vendor, I'm just not meant to have the item. Nothing is worth their online experience.",April 11 2021,11/4/2021,Helpful (1),1,,,1,1,,2,,
